cd accessible-tabs
npm install
npm start
```


**Summary of work**

- Updated all examples to use styling that will give correct layout indent using CSS Grid for IE 10 & IE 11.
- Updated examples 3 & 4 to use spacebar for selecting the tab.
- Created example 5 as an implementation of Leonie's tabpanel setup & tested it has the same interactions as the original example here does: https://design-patterns.tink.uk/tabpanels1/index.html

**TODO**

- Fix examples 3 & 4 to not collapse when you select the tabs.
- Fix the 'force the virtual buffer to update' aspect of option 1.
